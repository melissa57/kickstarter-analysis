Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

### Project Analysis


After the analysis performed on several thousand crowdfunding projects, we were able to obtain a better picture to inform Louise the best tactic to be able to conduct her first fundraising event to fund her play Fever.
* One of the first factor that were found to impact in the success of a project campaign was the launch date. The higher number of successful campaigns were done during the months of May and June. Being November and December the worst time to start a Kickstarter campaign with the higher number of failed projects.

* Another reason that seems to impact the successful of a campaign is the goal dollar amount. Failed campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns.
* Additional, among all fundraising categories, “theater” has a better rate of success as shown on the graph, which gives a good chance to Louise’s first campaign.

* One more factor that plays on favor for Louise’s project is that the subcategory “play” is the most popular as well among the classification, increasing her chances of success.

As conclusion, Louise has a couple of factors in her favor; the category of “theater” and subcategory of “play” were the fundraisers with more success, along with the observation of June being the best month for launching her project to increase her odds to achieve her target. Her goal amount is a lot higher than the average successful campaign goals but elaborating a good plan in conjunction with other factors that were not analyzed such marketing and other strategies related to increasing the magnitude of the event to impact the amount of people, she can increase her chances of success. 


### Challenge
Based on the analysis performed, I was able to observe the following:
* Launch date has a higher successful campaign during the summer months of May, June, and July, with a peak in May.
* The outcome based on “launch date” needs to include a percentage line to make understand the data better. 
* The failed graph shows a consistent failure amount of campaigns regardless of the time of the year, but it should not be used to conclude a recommendation.

* As we can see on the following graph (Outcomes Based on Goal), there is a decline in successful percentage as the campaign amount increase until the $30,000. Even though the success rate increases on campaigns with greater than $30,000 we must consider that these may not be as reliable given the lower data points (less than 25 campaigns). 

* The goal dollar amount affects the results. The more successful campaign with more reliable due to the higher amount of project is within campaigns of $5000 or less.

The outcome based on “goals” needs to include a “total project” line on a combo graph to see which data could be consider as reliable or unreliable.

The data is limited to provide with more information related to the planification of the fundraising event. Having a plan is a key factor for a successful Kickstarter campaign. The data set lack all the information related to the approached Louisa took regarding the marketing technique of the campaign, for example, the kind of event planned to raise money, the size of the event, the amount of people invited and the number of attendees. This information or data will help understand the successful and failed campaigns.
