Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

### Project Analysis


After the analysis performed on several thousand crowdfunding projects, we were able to obtain a better picture to inform Louise the best tactic to be able to conduct her first fundraising event to fund her play Fever.
* One of the first factor that were found to impact in the success of a project campaign was the launch date. The higher number of successful campaigns were done during the months of May and June. Being November and December the worst time to start a Kickstarter campaign with the higher number of failed projects.

* Another reason that seems to impact the successful of a campaign is the goal dollar amount. Failed campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns.
* Additional, among all fundraising categories, “theater” has a better rate of success as shown on the graph, which gives a good chance to Louise’s first campaign.

* One more factor that plays on favor for Louise’s project is that the subcategory “play” is the most popular as well among the classification, increasing her chances of success.

As conclusion, Louise has a couple of factors in her favor; the category of “theater” and subcategory of “play” were the fundraisers with more success, along with the observation of June being the best month for launching her project to increase her odds to achieve her target. Her goal amount is a lot higher than the average successful campaign goals but elaborating a good plan in conjunction with other factors that were not analyzed such marketing and other strategies related to increasing the magnitude of the event to impact the amount of people, she can increase her chances of success.
